Multiply John's daily pay of $80 by $20 to get his hourly rate: $80 x $20 = $160 per hour\n\n2. Subtract the daily rate from his estimated total pay for the workday: $80 - $160 = $60\n\n3. Multiply the estimated total pay for the workday by the bonus percentage (2 hours for 1 bonus, 1 hour for 0 bonus): 1 bonus + 1 bonus x 2 hours = 2 bonus hours of work\n\n4. Add the estimated total pay for the workday and the bonus hours of work: $80 + $60 + 2 bonus hours = $140 per hour\n\n5. Divide the estimated total pay for the workday by the number of hours John worked: $80 / 8\n\n6. Multiply the result by 24 to get John's hourly rate per day: $140 / 24\n\nHere's how John's hourly rate per day would change if he decided not to earn the bonus:\n\n1. Multiply John's daily pay of $80 by $0: $80 x $0 = $0\n\n2. Subtract the estimated total pay for the workday: $80 - $0 = $80\n\n3. Multiply the estimated total pay for the workday by the bonus percentage (2 hours for 1 bonus, 1 hour for 0 bonus): 1 bonus + 1 bonus x 2 hours = 2 bonus hours of work\n\n4.
